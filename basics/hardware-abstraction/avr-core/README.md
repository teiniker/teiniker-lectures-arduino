# Arduino Core Framework

**Arduino Libraries** are a collection of code that makes it easy for us 
to connect to a sensor, display, module, etc.

The **Arduino Core** is a set of configurations and code libraries that 
realizes an hardware abstraction layer commonly used to program and interact 
with a wide range of Arduino boards. 

_Examples:_ [Arduino Boards](https://www.arduino.cc/en/hardware) 

It includes definitions for the various I/O functions, as well as the 
implementation of the **Arduino language** (a set of C/C++ functions) that 
simplifies programming for these devices. 

The core provides essential support for standard Arduino functions like 
`digitalRead()`, `digitalWrite()`, and `analogRead()`, making it easier 
for developers to develop projects involving sensors, motors, and other 
peripherals.
