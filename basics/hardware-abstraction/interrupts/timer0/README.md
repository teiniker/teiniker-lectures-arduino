# Timer 0 Interrupt

In Arduino, the `millis()` function, which returns the number of
milliseconds since the Arduino board began running the current program, 
is typically implemented using one of the built-in hardware timers of 
the microcontroller. 

For most Arduino boards, including the Arduino Uno which uses the **ATmega328P** 
microcontroller, **millis() is driven by Timer 0**.

Here's how it works:

* **Timer 0 Configuration**: Timer 0 is set up to increment a counter every 
    millisecond. This is achieved by configuring the timer with a prescaler and, 
    if necessary, a compare match value, depending on the clock frequency of 
    the microcontroller.

* **Interrupt**: In some implementations, the timer is configured to 
    generate an overflow interrupt. In others, a compare match interrupt is used. 
    When this interrupt occurs (either on overflow or on compare match), an 
    interrupt service routine (ISR) is executed.

* **Incrementing the Millisecond Counter**: Inside this ISR, a global variable 
    that keeps track of the number of milliseconds is incremented. This variable 
    is what is returned by the `millis()` function.

* **Non-blocking and Asynchronous**: Since this process is interrupt-driven, it 
    operates independently of the main program loop, allowing `millis()` to count 
    up regardless of what the main program is doing, unless interrupts are disabled.


It's important to note that modifying Timer 0 or its interrupts can affect the 
behavior of `millis()`, as well as other functions that rely on it, such as 
`delay()` and `micros()`.
