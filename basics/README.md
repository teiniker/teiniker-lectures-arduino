# Microcontroller Programming Basics

In the following subchapters, the basic programming of microcontrollers will be shown using the example of Arduino Uno R3.
The components that are located directly in the microcontroller are used (timer, memory, IO ports, UART).
Programming is done using the Arduino Framework.

* [Serial Communication (UART)](serial/)
* [I/O Ports](io-ports/)
* [Memory](memory/)
* [Timing and Scheduling](timing/)
* [State Machines](state-machines/)
