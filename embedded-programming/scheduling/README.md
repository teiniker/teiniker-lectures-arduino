# Timing and Scheduling

In the context of embedded programming, cyclic processing and scheduling 
are fundamental concepts for managing **how tasks are executed** in an 
embedded system. 


* **Timing**
    - [delay() vs. millis()](timing/delay/introduction/README.md)
        - Example: [blink_delay](timing/delay/blink_delay/)
        - Example: [blink_millis()](timing/delay/blink_millis/)
    
    - [Timer](timing/timer/introduction/README.md)
        - Example: [blink_timer1](timing/timer/blink_timer1/)

    
* **Scheduling**
    - [Cyclic Processing](cyclic-processing/)
