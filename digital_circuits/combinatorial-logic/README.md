# Combinatorial Logic

There is a one-to-one relationship between **Boolean functions** and electronic circuits.

**Logical gates** are electronic circuits which operate on one or more input signals to produce an output signal. They respond to two separate voltage levels which represent a binary variable equivalent to logic-1 (5 volts) or logic-0 (0 volts).

* **Logical Gates**
    * [NOT Gate](gate-not)
    * [AND Gate](gate-and)
    * [OR Gate](gate-or)
    * [NAND Gate (implementing OR)](gate-nand-or)
