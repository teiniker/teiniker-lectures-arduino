# Radio Frequency Identification 

RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) systems operate at different frequency 
ranges, each suited for specific applications. 

## Low-Frequency (LF) RFID (30 kHz – 300 kHz)

* **Typical Frequency:** 125 kHz or 134.2 kHz
* **Read Range:** A few centimeters to about 10 cm
* **Advantages:** 
    - Works well near metal and water
    - Requires minimal power
    - Reliable for short-range tracking
* **Disadvantages:**
    - Slow data transfer rate
    - Very short read range
* **Applications:**
    - Animal tracking (ISO 11784/11785 standard for livestock)
    - Access control (key fobs, security badges)
    - Automotive immobilizers


## High-Frequency (HF) RFID (3 MHz – 30 MHz)

* **Typical Frequency:** 13.56 MHz
* **Read Range:** Up to 1 meter
* **Advantages:**
    - Moderate resistance to interference from liquids and metals
    - Better data transfer rates than LF
* **Disadvantages:**
    - Shorter read range compared to UHF
* **Applications:**
    - NFC (Near Field Communication) for contactless payments (e.g., credit cards, smartphones)
    - Library books and asset tracking
    - Electronic ticketing (subways, events)


## Ultra-High-Frequency (UHF) RFID (300 MHz – 3 GHz)

* **Typical Frequency:** 860 MHz – 960 MHz (varies by region)
* **Read Range:** Up to 12 meters (passive), 100+ meters (active)
* **Advantages:**
    - Long read range
    - High-speed data transfer
    - Capable of reading multiple tags at once (bulk scanning)
* **Disadvantages:**
    - Susceptible to interference from liquids and metals
    - More affected by environmental factors
* **Applications:**
    - Inventory and supply chain management
    - Retail anti-theft systems
    - Vehicle tracking (toll collection, fleet management)


## Microwave RFID (2.45 GHz and 5.8 GHz)

* **Read Range:** Can exceed 30 meters
* **Advantages:**
    - High data transfer rate
    - Suitable for long-range applications
* **Disadvantages:**
    - More expensive
    - Sensitive to interference
* **Applications:**
    - Electronic toll collection (e.g., E-ZPass)
    - High-speed tracking systems


## Passive vs. Active RFID

* **Passive RFID:** No battery; powered by the reader’s signal. Used in LF, HF, and UHF 
    applications.

* **Active RFID:** Has a battery and can transmit signals over longer distances. 
    Used mainly in UHF and Microwave RFID systems.

Each type of RFID frequency has its own strengths and is suited for specific use cases 
based on range, cost, and environmental factors.
