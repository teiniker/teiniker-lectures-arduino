# ESP32 Arduino Core

There is a dedicated implementation of the Arduino Core Framework for 
the ESP32 family.
Therefore, the same operations can be used as for the Arduino Uno.

Additionally, the ESP32 implementation offers the following features:

* [Serial.printf()](Serial.md)
* [String](String.md)
* [F() String](F-String.md)
