# Using a Breadboard

In electronics, breadboards are used to create quick **prototypes**.
Instead of soldering connections, they can simply be made with **jumper wires**.

Breadboards come in different sizes. It is important to remember how the individual tracks are connected internally:

* The **outermost tracks** (or busses) which are marked with `+` and `-` are connected horizontally - indicated by the black and red wires.

* The **inner tracks** (or rows) are each connected vertically - shown by the green wires.

* If you point to a lane with the mouse, the connection is briefly displayed.
