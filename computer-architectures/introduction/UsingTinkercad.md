# Using Tinkercad

**Tinkercad Circuits** is an easy way to get started with learning electronics. 
Using the interactive circuit editor, we can explore, connect, and code virtual projects with a bottomless toolbox of simulated components.

After signing in to Tinkercad we will find a dashboard of our recent designs. 
By default, this dashboard will showcase designs made with Tinkercadâ€™s 3D editor. 
To see a view of our Circuit designs, simply click the **Circuits** link in the left menu.

For practice, it is advisable to set up simple circuits on the breadboard without an Arduino.

_Example:_ [LED and Pushbutton (Tinkercad)](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/8kKVf82GV4V)

![LED and Pushbutton](figures/Breadboard-LED-Pushbutton.png)

In this circuit, a pushbutton is used to turn an LED on and off.
Each **LED needs a series resistor (330 ohms) to limit the current**.
In order to give the button's output a defined logical level, it is pulled to GND with a **pull-down resistor (10K ohms)**. The push-down resistor is not necessary for the LED control, for Arduino inputs it is.



A DIP switch can be used if several logical states are to be set.

_Example:_ [LEDs and DIP Switchs (Tinkercad)](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/edBOW4fxukG)

![LEDs and Switches](figures/Breadboard-LED-Switch.png)

In the example shown, 4 LEDs are controlled via 4 different DIP switches. 
Important in this circuit is the use of **series resistors (470 ohms) for the LEDs** and **pull-down resistors (10 KOhm) for the switches**.
