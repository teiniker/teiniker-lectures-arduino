# Introduction

Before we can talk about computer architecture, we need to look at how we 
can **build or simulate digital circuits**.

* [Simulations using TinkerCAD](UsingTinkercad.md)

* Prototyping in Electronics
    * [Breadboard vs. Perfboard](Prototyping.md)
    * [Power Adapter](power-supply/)


The following **YouTube tutorials** can be used to get an initial overview of the topic of computer architecture.

* [Crash Course: Computer Science](CrashCourse-ComputerScience.md)
