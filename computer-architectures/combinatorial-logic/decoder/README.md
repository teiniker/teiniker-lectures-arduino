## BCD to 7 Segment Decoder

**Binary Coded Decimal (BCD)** is the encoding scheme each of the decimal 
numbers(0-9) is represented by its equivalent binary pattern(which is 
generally of 4-bits).

**Seven Segment display** is an electronic device which consists of seven 
Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) arranged in a some definite pattern (common 
cathode or common anode type), which is used to display Hexadecimal 
numerals(in this case decimal numbers, as input is BCD i.e., 0-9).
