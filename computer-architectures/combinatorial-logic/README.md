# Combinatorial Logic

There is a one-to-one relationship between **Boolean functions** and electronic circuits.

**Logical gates** are electronic circuits which operate on one or more input signals to produce an output signal. They respond to two separate voltage levels which represent a binary variable equivalent to logic-1 (5 volts) or logic-0 (0 volts).

* **Logical Gates**
    * [NOT Gate](gate-not/)
    * [AND Gate](gate-and/)
    * [OR Gate](gate-or/)
    * [NAND Gate (implementing OR)](gate-nand-or/)
    * [XOR Gate](gate-xor/)

* **Combinatorial Logic**
   * [Adder](adder-4bit/)
   * [Decoder](decoder/)
   * [Encoder](encoder/)
