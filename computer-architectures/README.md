# Computer Architectures

The basic operational design of a computer system is called architecture.

The von Neumann Architecture (VNA) described the principal architecture used today which has three major components:
* **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**: performs all computations
* **Memory**: stores data and instructions
* **Input / Output Devices**: interact with the outside world

Data and machine instructions reside in memory until the CPU requests them.
To the CPU, most I/O devices look like memory.

In the following sections the basic mechanisms and components of computer architectures are examined.

* [Introduction](introduction/)
    
* [Combinatorial Logic](combinatorial-logic/)

* [Sequential Logic](sequential-logic/)

* Microcontroller
