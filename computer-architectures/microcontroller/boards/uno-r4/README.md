# Arduino Uno R4 Bords

## Arduino UNO R4 Minima
Enhanced and improved, the Arduino UNO R4 Minima is armed with a powerful **32-bit microcontroller** courtesy of Renesas. 
Brace yourself for increased processing power, expanded memory, and a whole new level of on-board peripherals. 
The best part? Compatibility with existing shields and accessories remains intact, and there's no need to make any 
changes to the standard form factor or 5 V operating voltage.

## Arduino UNO R4 WiFi
The Arduino UNO R4 WiFi combines the processing power and exciting new peripherals of the RA4M1 microcontroller 
from Renesas with the wireless connectivity power of the ESP32-S3 from Espressif. On top of this, the UNO R4 WiFi 
offers an on-board 12x8 LED matrix, Qwiic connector, VRTC, and OFF pin, covering all potential needs makers will 
have for their next project.
