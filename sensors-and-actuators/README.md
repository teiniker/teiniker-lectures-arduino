# Sensors and Actuators

The following examples are intended as **experiments in which the sensors and motors can be tried out**.

* The circuits must be set up as specified and tested with the programs provided in the repository.
  In some cases, Arduino libraries must be installed (these are located in the `lib` folders of the examples).

* If the circuit structure works together with the sketches, modifications and extensions can also
  be made.

* Finally, we can build more complex applications from the individual circuits and write the appropriate
  software for them.

## User Interface 
* [Button Debouncing](user-interface/button-debouncing/)
* [Analog Joystick](user-interface/joystick/)

* [LCD Display Module](user-interface/LCD-1602/)

## Sensors

* [Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SR04](sensors/hc-sr04/)

## Motors
* [Servo Motor](motors/ServoMotor/)
* [DC Motor](motors/DCMotor-L293/)
* [Stepper Motor](motors/StepperMotor/)
